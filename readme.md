Awesome Theology is a project to catalogue free and open source tools that assist the workflow of professional theologians and students taking theology classes in institutions of higher learning. 

We include:
- projects hosted on GitHub, GitLab, & other places that allow full source code transparency (Free Software Definition compliance is preferred, but open source w/o FSF compliance is tolerated)
- tools that can be installed as local applications or cloned for local use in some form
- software with simple interfaces (CLI & TUI are preferred, but GUI is tolerated when sensible)
- utilities that we have tested and actually use to assist our work

We do **not** include:
- projects without open source code
- tools that cannot be installed as local applications or cloned for local use in any form
- bloatware
- utilities that we have not tested and/or do not actually use to assist our work
