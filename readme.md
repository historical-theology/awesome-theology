# Awesome Theology [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of open source software for Catholic theology.

Awesome Theology is a catalogue of free and open source tools that assist the workflow of professional theologians and students taking theology classes in institutions of higher learning. It helps people who use things like GNU/Linux, tiling window managers, and terminal emulators work with things like ancient Christian Latin and Greek and medieval manuscripts.

We include:
- projects hosted on GitHub, GitLab, & elsewhere with full source code transparency
    - we prefer full Free Software Definition compliance, but we tolerate non-free open source projects
- tools that can be installed as local applications or cloned for local use in some form
- software with simple interfaces 
    - we prefer CLI & TUI, but we tolerate sensible GUI
    - we prefer items that align with the principles of the [Suckless Project](https://suckless.org/)
- utilities that we have tested and actually use to assist our work
