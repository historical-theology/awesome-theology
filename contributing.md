Make sure that you have read the description of what we include:
- projects hosted on GitHub, GitLab, & elsewhere with full source code transparency
    - we prefer full Free Software Definition compliance, but we tolerate non-free open source projects
- tools that can be installed as local applications or cloned for local use in some form
- software with simple interfaces & minimal bloat
    - we prefer CLI & TUI, but we tolerate sensible GUI
    - we prefer items that align with the principles of the [Suckless Project](https://suckless.org/)
- utilities that we have tested and actually use to assist our work

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a Pull Request (PR) adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers should notice anything that we would like to be changed, we will ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There is not any need to open a new PR. Instead, edit
the existing one. See this
[guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
for more information on how to edit an existing PR.
